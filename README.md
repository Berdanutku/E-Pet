# E-Pet

Our pets, which are members of our homes, will have a unique identity with the obligatory chip
application, and the E-pet system will be a health record and tracking system for them. It is very
important for animal owners to have an online health system for animals as it is for humans. The E-pet system works as a web and mobile application. The application is intended for use by pet
owners and veterinarians.
